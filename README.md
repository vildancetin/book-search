# Book Search

This book listing project retrieves authors' names from data and displays them on the screen. The search functionality allows users to search for a specific book. Lifting up state is implemented to list the books of the clicked author. In the parent component, states related to the click event are maintained, and the state-changing process is passed down to the child component as props. The favorite addition feature in the card structure is also managed through a separate state. Additionally, if liked, the heart icon will turn red.
